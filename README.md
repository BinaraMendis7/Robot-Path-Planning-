# Robot-Path-Planning-
This project implements a robot path planning algorithm using a graph-based approach. Nodes represent locations, and edges define paths. Custom data structures like queues, array lists, and graphs efficiently manage traversal. The system finds optimal paths while considering obstacles and constraints.
